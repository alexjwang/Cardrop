# Getting Started with Smartcar

Smartcar is an API that allows mobile and web applications to communicate with vehicles across brands (think “check odometer” or “unlock doors.”). This guide will help you get up and running with the Smartcar API.

In the Getting Started guide, we will create a simple web application that displays your car information.

By the end of this guide, you will have learned how Smartcar works, how to get your API keys, learned about our authentication process and made your first request to Smartcar using your preferred SDKs.
